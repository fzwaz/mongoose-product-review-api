# **Product Review System — MongoDB Schema (Mongoose)**

---

## **Overview**

This project defines a **clean, scalable MongoDB schema** for a **Product Review Platform** using **Mongoose**.  
It includes two core models — **Product** and **Review** — connected through **referencing** for relational consistency.

---

## **Highlights**

- Built using **Mongoose** with strong validation (**required**, **enum**, **min**, **max**).  
- Implemented **referencing** between reviews and products to ensure normalized data.  
- Added **default values**, **trimmed strings**, and **custom error messages** for production-readiness.  
- Structured using **timestamps** and **version control disabled** for clean API responses.
